<h5 class="likesubsubsectionHead"><a 
 id="x5-80001"></a>Where does it come from?</h5>
<!--l. 19--><p class="noindent" >ROOM was developed in the 1990th on the background of the upcoming mobile applications with the goal to manage the
complexity of such huge SW-Systems. From the very beginning ROOM has focused on a certain type of SW-Systems and is,
in contrast to the UML, well suited for this kind of systems. In this sense, ROOM is a DSL (Domain Specific Language) for
distributed, event driven, real time systems.
</p><!--l. 24--><p class="noindent" >Bran Selic, Garth Gullekson and Paul T. Ward have published the concepts 1994 in the book <span 
class="ec-lmssbx-10">Real-Time Object-Oriented</span>
<span 
class="ec-lmssbx-10">Modeling</span>. The company <span 
class="ec-lmsso-10">ObjecTime</span><sup class="textsuperscript"><span 
class="ec-lmss-9">TM</span></sup> developed a ROOM tool which was taken over by <span 
class="ec-lmsso-10">Rational SW</span><sup class="textsuperscript"><span 
class="ec-lmss-9">TM</span></sup> and later on by
<span 
class="ec-lmsso-10">IBM</span><sup class="textsuperscript"><span 
class="ec-lmss-9">TM</span></sup>. The company <span 
class="ec-lmsso-10">Protos Software GmbH</span><sup class="textsuperscript"><span 
class="ec-lmss-9">TM</span></sup> also developed a ROOM tool called <span 
class="ec-lmsso-10">Trice</span><sup class="textsuperscript"><span 
class="ec-lmss-9">TM</span></sup> for control software
for production machines and automotive systems. <span 
class="ec-lmsso-10">Trice</span><sup class="textsuperscript"><span 
class="ec-lmss-9">TM</span></sup> is the predecessor of eTrice (see Introduction to
eTrice).
                                                                                            
                                                                                            
</p><!--l. 32--><p class="noindent" >From our point of view ROOM provides still the clearest, simplest, most complete and best suited modeling concepts for the
real time domain. All later proposals like the UML do not fit as well to this kind of problems.
<a 
 id="Q1-5-10"></a>
</p>
<h5 class="likesubsubsectionHead"><a 
 id="x5-90001"></a>Which kind of SW-Systems will be addressed?</h5>
<!--l. 38--><p class="noindent" >As mentioned before ROOM addresses distributed, event driven, real time systems. But what is a <span 
class="ec-lmsso-10">real time system</span>? ROOM
defines a set of properties which are typical for a real time system. These properties are:
</p>
     <ul class="itemize1">
     <li class="itemize">Timeliness
     </li>
     <li class="itemize">Dynamic internal structure
     </li>
     <li class="itemize">Reactiveness
     </li>
     <li class="itemize">Concurrency
     </li>
     <li class="itemize">Distribution
     </li>
     <li class="itemize">Reliability</li></ul>
<!--l. 51--><p class="noindent" >Each of these properties has potential to make SW development complex. If a given system can be characterized with a
combination of or all of these properties, ROOM might be applied to such a system.
</p><!--l. 54--><p class="noindent" >As an example take a look at a washing machine. The system has to react to user interactions, has to handle
some error conditions like a closed water tap or a defective lye pump. It has to react simultaneously to all
these inputs. It has to close the water valve within a certain time to avoid flooding the basement. So, the
system can be characterized as timely, concurrent and reactive. As long as the washing machine does not
transform to a laundry drier by itself, the system has no dynamic internal structure and as long as all functions
are running on a single micro controller the (SW)-system is not distributed. ROOM fits perfect to such a
system.
</p><!--l. 62--><p class="noindent" >A SW system which mainly consists of data transformations like signal/image processing or a loop controller (e.g. a PID
controller) cannot be characterized with any of the above mentioned properties. However, in the real world most
of the SW systems will be a combination of both. ROOM can be combined with such systems, so that for
example an actor provides a <span 
class="ec-lmsso-10">run to completion </span>context for calculating an image processing algorithm or a PID
controller.
<a

</p>
<h5 class="likesubsubsectionHead"><a 
 id="x5-100001"></a>What is the relation between OOP and ROOM?</h5>
<!--l. 70--><p class="noindent" >The relation between classical object oriented programming and ROOM is comparable to the relation between assembler
programming and C programming. It provides a shift of the object paradigm. The classical object paradigm provides some
kind of information hiding. Attributes can be accessed via access methods. Logical higher level methods provide the requested
behavior to the user.
</p><!--l. 75--><p class="noindent" >But as the figure illustrates, the classical object paradigm does not care about concurrency issues. The threads of control will
be provided by the underlying operating system and the user is responsible to avoid access violations by using those operating
system mechanisms directly (semaphore, mutex).
</p><!--l. 79--><p class="noindent" ><img 
src="images/010-RoomIntroduction02.png" alt="PIC"  
 />
</p><!--l. 81--><p class="noindent" >ROOM provides the concept of a logical machine (called actor) with its own thread of control. It provides some kind of
cooperative communication infrastructure with <span 
class="ec-lmsso-10">run to completion </span>semantics. That makes developing of business logic easy
and safe (see <a 
href="#x5-130002">1.2.2<!--tex4ht:ref: sec:basic_concepts --></a> <a 
href="#x5-130002">Basic Concepts<!--tex4ht:ref: sec:basic_concepts --></a>). The logical machine provides an encapsulation shell including concurrency issues (see
<a 
href="#x5-170002">1.2.2<!--tex4ht:ref: sec:run_to_completion --></a> <a 
href="#x5-170002">Run to Completion<!--tex4ht:ref: sec:run_to_completion --></a>).
</p><!--l. 86--><p class="noindent" ><img 
src="images/010-RoomIntroduction03.png" alt="PIC"  
 />
</p><!--l. 88--><p class="noindent" >This thinking of an object is much more general than the classic one.
                                                                                            
                                                                                            
<a 
 id="Q1-5-14"></a>
</p>
<h5 class="likesubsubsectionHead"><a 
 id="x5-110001"></a>What are the benefits of ROOM?</h5>
<!--l. 92--><p class="noindent" >ROOM has a lot of benefits and it depends on the users point of view which is the most important one. From a general point
of view the most important benefit is, that ROOM allows to create SW systems very efficient, robust and safe due to the fact
that it provides some abstract, high level modeling concepts combined with code generation and a small efficient runtime
environment.
</p><!--l. 97--><p class="noindent" >In detail: </p>
     <ul class="itemize1">
     <li class="itemize">ROOM models contain well defined interfaces (protocols), which makes it easy to re-use components in different
     applications or e.g. in a test harness.
     </li>
     <li class="itemize">Graphical modeling makes it easy to understand, maintain and share code with other developers
     </li>
     <li class="itemize">Higher abstraction in combination with automated code generation provides very efficient mechanisms to the
     developer.
     </li>
     <li class="itemize">ROOM provides graphical model execution, which makes it easy to understand the application or find defects
     in a very early phase.</li></ul>
<a 
 id="Q1-5-16"></a>
<h5 class="likesubsubsectionHead"><a 
 id="x5-120001"></a>Which consequences must be taken into account?</h5>
<!--l. 110--><p class="noindent" >Generating code from models will introduce some overhead in terms of memory footprint as well as performance. For most
systems the overhead will be negligible. However, the decision for using ROOM should be made explicitly and it is always a
trade off between development costs, time to market and costs in terms of a little bit more of memory and performance.
Thanks to the powerful component model, ROOM is especially well suited for the development of software product lines with
their need for reusable core assets.
</p><!--l. 116--><p class="noindent" >Care must be taken during the introduction of the new methodology. Due to the fact that ROOM provides
a shift of the object paradigm, developers and teams need a phase of adaption. Every benefit comes at a
price.

 id="x5-140002"></a>Actor, Port, Protocol</h5>
<!--l. 124--><p class="noindent" >The basic elements of ROOM are the actors with their ports and protocols. The protocol provides a formal interface
description. The port is an interaction point where the actor interacts with its outside world. Each port has exactly one
protocol attached. The sum of all ports builds up the complete interface of an actor. Each port can receive messages, with or
without data, which are defined in the attached protocol. Each message will be handled by the actor&#8217;s behavior (state
machine) or will be delegated to the actor&#8217;s internal structure.

<!--l. 140--><p class="noindent" >The actor provides access protection for its own attributes (including complex types, i.e. classical objects), including
concurrency protection. An actor has neither public attributes nor public operations. The only interaction with the outside
world takes place via interface ports. This ensures a high degree of re-usability on the actor level and provides an effective and
safe programming model to the developer.
</p><!--l. 145--><p class="noindent" >Receiving a message via a port will trigger the internal state machine. A transition will be executed depending on the message
and the current state. Within this transition, detail level code will be executed and response messages can be
sent.
</p><!--l. 149--><p class="noindent" >With this model, a complex behavior can be divided into many relatively simple, linked actors. To put it the other way round:
The complex behavior will be provided by a network of relatively simple components which are communicating with each
other via well defined interfaces.

<h5 class="likesubsubsectionHead"><a 
 id="x5-150002"></a>Hierarchy in Structure and Behavior</h5>
<!--l. 156--><p class="noindent" >ROOM provides two types of hierarchy. Behavioral hierarchy and structural hierarchy. Structural hierarchy means that actors
can be nested to arbitrary depth. Usually you will add more and more details to your application with each nesting level. That
means you can focus yourself on any level of abstraction with always the same element, the actor. Structural hierarchy
provides a powerful mechanism to divide your problem in smaller pieces, so that you can focus on the level of abstraction you
want to work on.
</p><!--l. 162--><p class="noindent" >The actor&#8217;s behavior will be described with a state machine. A state in turn may contain sub states. This is
another possibility to focus on an abstraction level. Take the simple FSM from the blinky actor from the blinky
tutorial.
</p><!--l. 166--><p class="noindent" >Top level:

</p><!--l. 174--><p class="noindent" >From an abstract point of view there is a state <span 
class="ec-lmsso-10">blinking</span>. But a simple LED is not able to blink autonomously. Therefore you
have to add more details to your model to make a LED blinking, but for the current work it is not of interest how the blinking
is realized. This will be done in the next lower level of the hierarchy.
</p><!--l. 179--><p class="noindent" >This simple example might give an idea how powerful this mechanisms is.
</p><!--l. 181--><p class="noindent" >The hierarchical FSM provides a rich tool box to describe real world problems (see chapter <a

</p>
<h5 class="likesubsubsectionHead"><a 
 id="x5-160002"></a>Layering</h5>
<!--l. 185--><p class="noindent" >Layering is another well known form of abstraction to reduce complexity in the structure of systems. ROOM is
probably the only language that supports layering directly as a language feature. Layering can be expressed in
ROOM by actors with specialized ports, called <span 
class="ec-lmsso-10">Service Access Points </span>(SAP) and <span 
class="ec-lmsso-10">Service Provision Points</span>
(SPP).
</p><!--l. 190--><p class="noindent" >The actor that provides a service implements an SPP and the client of that service implements an SAP. The layer connection
connects all SAPs of a specific protocol within an actor hierarchy with an SPP that implements the service. From the actor&#8217;s
point of view, SAPs and SPPs behave almost like ports.
</p><!--l. 194--><p class="noindent" ><img 
src="images/010-LayerExample.png" alt="PIC"  
 />
</p><!--l. 196--><p class="noindent" >The example shows a layered model. The layer connections define e.g. that the <span 
class="ec-lmsso-10">ApplicationLayer </span>can only use the services of
the <span 
class="ec-lmsso-10">ServiceLayer </span>and the <span 
class="ec-lmsso-10">CommunicationLayer</span>. Actors inside the <span 
class="ec-lmsso-10">ApplicationLayer </span>that implement an SAP for those services
are connected directly to the implementation of the services. Layering and actor hierarchies with port to port connections can
be mixed on every level of granularity.

<h5 class="likesubsubsectionHead"><a 
 id="x5-170002"></a>Run to Completion</h5>
<!--l. 205--><p class="noindent" ><span 
class="ec-lmsso-10">Run to completion </span>(RTC) is a very central concept of ROOM. It enables the developer to concentrate on the functional
                                                                                            
                                                                                            
aspects of the system. The developer doesn&#8217;t have to care about concurrency issues all the time. This job is
concentrated to the system designer in a very flexible way. What does <span 
class="ec-lmsso-10">run to completion </span>mean: RTC means that
an actor, which is processing a message, can not receive the next message as long as the processing of the
current message has been finished. Receiving of the next message will be queued by the underlying run time
system.
</p><!--l. 213--><p class="noindent" >Note: It is very important not to confuse <span 
class="ec-lmsso-10">run to completion </span>and <span 
class="ec-lmsso-10">cooperative multi threading</span>. Run to completion
means that an actor will finish the processing of a message before he can receive a new one (regardless of its
priority). That does <span 
class="ec-lmsso-10">not </span>mean that an actor cannot be preempted from an higher priority thread of control. But
even a message from this higher prior thread of control will be queued until the current processing has been
finished.
</p><!--l. 220--><p class="noindent" >With this mechanism all actor internal attributes and data structures are protected. Due to the fact that multiple actors share
one thread of control, all objects are protected which are accessed from one thread of control but multiple actors. This
provides the possibility to decompose complex functionality into several actors without the risk to produce access violations or
dead locks.

<!--l. 266--><p class="noindent" >In present-day&#8217;s embedded systems in most cases one or several of the following execution models are used:
<a 
 id="Q1-5-35"></a>
<span 
class="ec-lmssbx-10">message driven   </span><br 
class="newline" />
The message driven execution model is a combination of message driven communication and execution by receive event. This
model allows for distributed systems with a very high throughput. It can be deterministic but the determinism is hard to
proof. This execution model is often found in telecommunication systems and high performance automation control
systems.
<a 
 id="Q1-5-36"></a>
<span 
class="ec-lmssbx-10">data driven   </span><br 
class="newline" />
The data driven execution model is a combination of data driven communication and polled execution. This model is highly
deterministic and very robust, but the polling creates a huge performance overhead. The determinism is easy to proof (simple
mathematics). The execution model is also compatible with the execution model of control software generated by Tools like
Matlab(TM) and LabView(TM). This model is usually used for systems with requirements for safety, such as automotive and
avionic systems.
<a 
 id="Q1-5-37"></a>
<span 
class="ec-lmssbx-10">synchronous   </span><br 
class="newline" />
The synchronous execution model could also be called <span 
class="ec-lmsso-10">function calls</span>. This model in general is not very well suited to support
the <span 
class="ec-lmsso-10">run to completion </span>semantics typical for ROOM models, but could also be generated from ROOM models. With this
execution model also lower levels of a software system, such as device drivers, could be generated from ROOM
models.
