Feature PhysicalModel
	description '''The PhysicalModel defines the setup of your nodes with their attributes like threads and mode of execution.'''
	text '''
		The model describes the physical view of your system:
		\begin{lstlisting}[language=etPhys]
		PhysicalSystem PhysSys1 {
			NodeRef server : ServerNode
			NodeRef embeddedClient : MCNode
		}
		\end{lstlisting}

		The central element is a NodeClass, that models the executional aspects of a device (node).
		At first, it can be associated with a RuntimeClass, which specifies if your device supports multiple threads.
		'priomin' and 'priomax' define the range of priorities, that can be assigned to threads.

		\begin{lstlisting}[language=etPhys]
		NodeClass NodeClass1 {
			runtime = RuntimeClass1
			priomin = -10
			priomax = 10

			// Thread definitions ...
		}

		RuntimeClass RuntimeClass1 {
			model = multiThreaded // or singleThreaded
		}
		\end{lstlisting}

		A thread has to specify the following properties:
		\begin{itemize}
			\item \textbf{execmode}: defines the execution type, see more at ExecutionType
			\begin{itemize}
				\item blocked: message-driven only, thread wakes up if message arrives and is put to sleep after all action is done
				\item polled: data-driven only, thread is executed cyclic. The 'interval' property is mandatory in this case.
				\item mixed: combines both execution types
			\end{itemize}
			\item \textbf{msgblocksize}: the size in bytes of a message
			\item \textbf{msgpoolsize}:  the amount of messages, that the thread's message queue can store
		\end{itemize}
		Note: 'msgblocksize' and 'msgpoolsize' also apply to the polled execution due the internal implementation via message passing.
		 The size of the message queue can be calculated as follows: msgpoolsize * msgblocksize bytes 

		\begin{lstlisting}[language=etPhys]
		DefaultThread ThreadMessaging {
			execmode = polled
			prio = 0
			stacksize = 1024
			msgblocksize = 32

Feature MappingModel
	description '''The MappingModel describes the mapping of elements of the LogicalModel to elements of the PhysicalModel.'''

		It enables the complete decoupling of the LogicalModel and the PhysicalModel, thus providing a maximum flexibility and reuse for the models.
		
		The model starts with an import part, where you can import .room and .etphys models. They should contain at least one LogicalSystem and one PhysicalSystem.
		The following mapping entry puts both in relation, meaning that all subsystems and actors contained in the hierarchical structure of the LogicalSystem should be executed within the given PhysicalSystem.
		With an SubSystemMapping you can distribute your subsystems to nodes. Afterwards you can map the logical threads within this subsystems to physical threads.

		references to ActorClass elements which again contain (recursively) references to 
		ActorClass elements. The complete structural hierarchy implies a tree which has the 
		LogicalSystem as root and where each reference stands for a new node with possibly further

		An ActorClass consists of three main parts:

These elements are accessible from the Behavior part of the actor (in contrary to the external interface above). An ActorClass can be composed of other actors again by declaring ActorRefs. Also this part declares the connection of ports in form of Bindings and LayerConnections.
		\item \textbf{Behavior} is described by the StateMachine. It can receive and send messages from the ports, declared in the Structure above. The Attributes can be used to store data during an state transition. Furthermore it is possible to declare Operations. They can be used to define reusable logic, that is invoked during a state transition.

Feature ExecutionType
	description '''Determines the execution type of an actor.'''

		Since from ROOM models executable code can be generated, it is important to define the way the actors are 
		executed and communicate with each other. The combination of communication and execution is called the 
		\emph{execution model}. Therefore the ExecutionType of an actor and the CommunicationType of the ports has to be considered.

		The ExecutionType of an ActorClass specifies in which way its instance (ActorRef) should be executed:
		\begin{itemize}
		\item \textbf{execution by receive event}: The message queue or the event dispatcher calls a 
		\textbf{receive event} function of the message receiver and thereby executes the processing of the event.
		\item \textbf{polled execution}: The objects are processed by a cyclic \textbf{execute} call
		\item \textit{\textbf{execution by function call}: The caller executes the called object via function call} (not supported yet)
		\item \textbf{mixture}: An asynchronous execution combines an event dispachter and a polled execution.
		\end{itemize}

		Thereby the ExecutionType determines the execution mode of the actor's logical thread:
		\includegraphics[width=.7\textwidth]{images/010-RoomIntroduction03.png}
				
		The actual execution of the underlying physical thread can be specified in the PhysicalModel in conjunction with the MappingModel.

		ExecutionType relates to the \hyperlink{ref:CommunicationType}{CommunicationType}, e.g. if an actor uses data-driven ports, it should support an polled execution.

		The CommunicationType of a ProtocolClass (and thus of a Port) specifies in which way the communication should happen:

		\begin{itemize}
		\item \textbf{message driven} -- asynchronous, non blocking, no return value:\\
		Usually the message driven communication is implemented with message queues. Message queues are inherently asynchronous and enable a very good decoupling of the communicating parties.
		\item \textbf{data driven} -- asynchronous, non blocking, no return value:\\
		In data driven communication sender and receiver often have a shared block of data. The sender writes the data and the receiver polls the data.
		\item \textit{\textbf{function call} -- synchronous, blocking, return value:\\
		Regular function call as known in most programming languages.} (not supported yet)

abstract Feature Port
	description '''A Port is an instance of a ProtocolClass and the interface for an ActorClass.'''
	text '''
		Once a ProtocolClass has been created, it can be used to define actor interfaces. This is accomplished by means of Ports. 
		A Port is a declaration that the set of messages defined by its ProtocolClass is now part of the actor's interface.
		It provides strong decoupling of ActorClasses from each other, thus enabling easy testability, reusability and deployment of actors to different threads or nodes.

		\begin{lstlisting}[language=ROOM]
		ActorClass Example {
			Structure{
				Port port0 : ProtocolClass1
			}
			Behavior {
				// send/receive message from port0
			}
		}
		\end{lstlisting}
		
		For communication between two actors to take place, a connection must be established between a port on one of the actors and a port on the other.
		One condition is, that both Ports have compatible ProtocolClasses. In most cases the Ports simply refer to the same protocol.
		In addition, a ProtocolClass has an imposed directionality - it defines one subset of messages as incoming and the complementary subset as outgoing.
		Which subset is labelled as incoming and outgoing is arbitray, it simply depends on the point of view, that was taken when defining.
		Therefore Ports can be 'regular' and 'conjugated'. When two actors communicate by a connected pair of Ports, one Port has to be regular and the other conjugated.
		The ProtocolClass' incoming messages are on one side received by the regular Port and on the other sent by the conjugated Port (outgoing message vice versa).

		A connection of Ports is denoted by a Binding.
