<p>Room was developed in the 1990th on the background of the upcoming mobile applications with the goal to manage the complexity of such huge SW-Systems. From the very beginning ROOM has focused on a certain type of SW-Systems and, is in contrast to the UML, well suited for this kind of systems. In this sense, ROOM is a DSL (Domain Specific Language) for distributed, event driven, real time systems. </p>
<p>Bran Selic, Garth Gullekson and Paul T. Ward have published the concepts 1994 in the book &bdquo;REAL-TIME OBJECT-ORIENTED MODELING&rdquo;. The company 
					[<span class="citation">object time</span>] &trade; developed a ROOM tool which was taken over from 
					[<span class="citation">Rational SW</span>] &trade; and later on from 
					[<span class="citation">IBM</span>] &trade;. Unfortunately the tool is no longer maintained from 
					[<span class="citation">IBM</span>] &trade;. The company 
					[<span class="citation">Protos SW Gmbh</span>] &trade; also developed a ROOM tool called 
					[<span class="citation">trice</span>] &trade; for controlling production machines. 
					[<span class="citation">Trice</span>] &trade; is the predecessor of eTrice (see Introduction to eTrice). 
				</p>
<p>From our point of view ROOM provides still the clearest, simplest, completest and best suited modeling concepts for the real time domain. All later proposals like the UML does not fit such perfect to this kind of problems.</p>

<p>As mentioned before ROOM addresses distributed, event driven, real time systems. But what is a &bdquo;real time system&rdquo;? ROOM defines a set of properties which are typically for a real time system. This properties are:</p>
<div class="itemizedlist">
<ul class="itemizedlist" type="disc">
<li class="listitem">
<p>Timeliness</p>
</li>
<li class="listitem">
<p>dynamic internal structure</p>
</li>
<li class="listitem">
<p>Reactiveness</p>
</li>
<li class="listitem">
<p>Concurrent</p>
</li>
<li class="listitem">
<p>Distributed</p>
</li>
<li class="listitem">
<p>Reliable</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p>Each of this properties has potential to make SW development complex. If a given system can be characterized which some or all of this properties, ROOM might be applied to such a system.  </p>
<p>As an example take a look at a washing machine. The system has to react on user interactions, has to handle some error conditions like a closed water tap or a defective lye pump. It has to react simultaneously to all this inputs. It has to close the water valve in a certain time to avoid flooding the basement. 
					So, the system can by characterized as timeliness, concurrent and reactive. As long as the washing machine does not transform to a laundry dryer by themself, the system has no dynamic internal structure and as long as all functions are running on a single microcontroller the (SW)-system is not distributed. 
					ROOM fits perfect to such a system.</p>
<p>A SW system which mainly consists of data transformations like signal/image processing or loop controller (PID regulator) cannot be characterized with any of the above mentioned properties. However, in the real world most of the SW systems will be a combination of both. ROOM can be combined with such systems, so that for example an actor provides a 
					[<span class="citation">run to completion</span>] context for calculating a image processing algorithm.

<a name="WhatistherelationbetweenOOPandROOM"></a>What is the relation between OOP and ROOM?</h3>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>The relation between classic object oriented programming and ROOM is comparable to the relation between assembler programming and C programming. It provides a shift of the object paradigm. As the picture shows, the classic object paradigm provides some kind of information hiding. Attributes can be accessed via access methods. Logical higher level methods provides the requested behavior to the user.   </p>
<p>
					
</p>
<div class="mediaobject">
<img src="images/010-RoomIntroduction01.png"></div>
<p>
				
</p>
<p>As the figure illustrates, the classic object paradigm does not care about concurrency issues. The threads of control will be provided from the underlying operating system and the user is responsible to avoid access violations by using operating system mechanisms (semaphore, mutex).</p>
<p>
					
</p>
<div class="mediaobject">
<img src="images/010-RoomIntroduction02.png"></div>
<p>
				
</p>
<p>ROOM provides the concept of a logical machine (called actor) with it&acute;s own thread of control. It provides some kind of cooperative communication infrastructure with &bdquo;run to completion&rdquo; semantic. That makes developing of business logic easy and save (see basic concepts). The logical machine provides an encapsulation shell including concurrency issues (see chapter &bdquo;Run to completion&rdquo;). </p>
<p>
					
</p>
<div class="mediaobject">
<img src="images/010-RoomIntroduction03.png"></div>
<p>
				
</p>
<p>This thinking of an object is much more general than the classic one.  </p>
</div>
<div class="section" title="What are the benefits of ROOM?">

<h3 class="title">
<a name="WhatarethebenefitsofROOM"></a>What are the benefits of ROOM?</h3>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>ROOM has a lot of benefits and it depends on the users point of view which is the most important one. From a general point of view the most important benefit is, that ROOM allows to create SW systems very efficient, robust and safe due to the fact that it provides some abstract, high level modeling concepts combined with code generation and a small efficient runtime environment.  </p>
<p>In detail:</p>
<div class="itemizedlist">
<ul class="itemizedlist" type="disc">
<li class="listitem">
<p>ROOM models contain well defined interfaces (protocols). That makes it easy to reuse components in different applications or e.g. in a test harness. </p>
</li>
<li class="listitem">
<p>Graphical modeling makes it easy to understand, maintain and share code with other developers</p>
</li>
<li class="listitem">
<p>Higher abstraction in combination with automated code generation provides very efficient mechanisms to the developer. </p>
</li>
<li class="listitem">
<p>ROOM provides graphical model execution, which makes it easy to understand the application or  find defects in a very early phase. </p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section" title="Which consequences must be taken into account?">
<div class="titlepage">
<div>

<h3 class="title">
<a name="Whichconsequencesmustbetakenintoaccount"></a>Which consequences must be taken into account?</h3>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>Generating code from models will introduce some overhead in terms of footprint as well as performance. For most systems the overhead will be negligible. However, the decision using ROOM should be made explicitly and it is always a tread of between development costs, time to market and costs in terms of a little bit more of memory and performance. As mentioned, in most cases the decision will be very clear. Especially in case of product lines or products which requires maintenance or feature updates, the ROOM methodology has big advantages.  </p>
<p>Care must be taken during introduction of the new methodology. Due to the fact that ROOM provides a shift of the object paradigm, developers often needs a phase of adaption. Even some of them will never adapt.</p>
