\chapter{Working with the \eTrice{} Tutorials}

The \eTrice{} Tutorials will help you to learn and understand the \eTrice{} tool and concepts. \eTrice{} supports 
several target languages. The concepts will not be explained for each language. 

Most of the common concepts will be described for Java as target language. To start with a new language the 
first steps to setup the workspace and to generate and run the first model will be described also. Target 
language specific aspects will be described as well.

Therefore the best way to start with \eTrice{} is to follow the Java Tutorials and after that switch to your 
target language.
