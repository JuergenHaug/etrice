\section{Working with the tutorials}

The \eTrice{} tutorials will help you to learn and understand the \eTrice{} tool and concepts. \eTrice{} supports 
several target languages. 
The chapter setting up the workspace exists for each target language. Those are currently Java and C. The C++ generator 
and runtime are currently prototypes with no tutorials. 

The other tutorials work for all target languages. Target language specific aspects are explained for all languages. 

\eTrice{} generates code out of ROOM models. The generated code relies on the services of a runtime 
framework:
\begin{itemize}
\item execution
\item communication (e.g. messaging)
\item logging
\item operating system abstraction (osal)
\end{itemize}

Additional functionality is provided as model library:
\begin{itemize}
\item socket server and client
\item timing service
\item standard types
\end{itemize}

Additionally the tutorial models are be provided to make it easy to start with \eTrice{}. All those projects 
should be available in our workspace before you start working with the tutorials.
