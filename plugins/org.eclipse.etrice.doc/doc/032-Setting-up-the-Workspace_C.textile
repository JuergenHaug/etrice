h1. Setting up the Workspace ( C )
 
Before you can start with C, some preconditions must be fulfilled:

- A C compiler must be installed on your machine (all tests and tutorials are based on MinGW)
- The CDT-Eclipse plug in must be installed as the C development environment.

Once the CDT is installed, the C runtime and model library must be imported.

The resulting workspace should look like this:

h2. Testing the environment

To verify the C tool chain you should generate and run the Hello World example program of the CDT.
 Activate the _C/C++_ perspective.
