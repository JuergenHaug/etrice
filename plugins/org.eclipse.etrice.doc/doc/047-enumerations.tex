\section{Enumerations}

Another top level type that \eTrice{} introduces is the \texttt{Enumeration}.
Enumerations are well known from many programming languages. They basically are a lists
of literals, each of which is a pair consisting of a name and an integer constant.

The assignment of integer constants is optional in \eTrice{}. If no value is specified
then the value is that of the predecessor plus one or 0 if there is no predecessor.

The default type of the enumeration is an \texttt{int} and depends on the target platform.
But it is also possible to explicitly associate a \texttt{PrimitiveType} (of integer type of course)
with the enumeration.

In the following listing we show a couple of examples for enumerations.
