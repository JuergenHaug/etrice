\section{\eTrice{} Overview}

\subsection{What is \eTrice{}?}

\eTrice{} provides an implementation of the ROOM modeling language (Real Time Object Oriented Modeling) 
together with editors, code generators for Java, C++ and C code and exemplary target middleware.

The model is defined in textual form (Xtext) with graphical editors (Graphiti) for the structural and 
behavioral (i.e. state machine) parts.

\subsection{Reduction of Complexity}

\eTrice{} is all about the reduction of complexity:

\begin{itemize}
\item structural complexity
	\begin{itemize}
	\item by explicit modeling of hierarchical Actor containment, layering and inheritance
	\end{itemize}
\item behavioral complexity
	\begin{itemize}
	\item by hierarchical state machines with inheritance
	\end{itemize}
\item team work complexity
	\begin{itemize}
	\item because loosely coupled Actors provide a natural way to structure team work
	\item since textual model notation allows simple branching and merging
	\end{itemize}
\item complexity of concurrent \& distributed systems
	\begin{itemize}
	\item because loosely coupled Actors are deployable to threads, processes, nodes
	\end{itemize}
\item complexity of variant handling and reuse (e.g. for product lines)
	\begin{itemize}
	\item by composition of existing Actors to new structures
	\item since Protocols and Ports make Actors replaceable
	\item by inheritance for structure, behavior and Protocols
	\item by making use of model level libraries 
	\end{itemize}
\item complexity of debugging
	\begin{itemize}
	\item model level debugging: state machine animation, data inspection and manipulation, message injection, 
	generated message sequence charts
	\item model checking easier for model than for code (detect errors before they occur)
	\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
