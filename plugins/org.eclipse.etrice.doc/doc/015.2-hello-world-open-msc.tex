\subsection{Open the Message Sequence Chart}

For debugging and learning purposes, the application produced a Message Sequence Chart and wrote it to a file. Open the file \emph{subSysRef1\_Async.seq} or \emph{msc.seq} in the folder \emph{HelloWorld/tmp/log/} using the tool Trace2UML. Create the path if not already there.

Trace2UML is an open source MSC viewer and can be obtained here:
\begin{itemize}
\item \href{http://trace2uml.tigris.org/}{Trace2UML project home and download of windows version} 
\item \href{http://apt.astade.de/}{download of the Linux package of the Astade UML tool which contains Trace2UML}
\end{itemize}
After opening the file, you should see something like this:

% !images/015-HelloWorld09.png!

The Actor with the instance path \emph{/LogSys1/subSysRef1/actorRef1} is in the state \emph{state0}. 
This is the simplest possible MSC. The MSCs for further tutorials will contain more information.
