For some reason a second "build all" does something but doesn't change the contents of the binary, features and plugins folder
inside this update site plug-in.
Also the artifacts.jar and the content.jar are not updated.

Workaround:
use files from
<workspace>\.metadata\.plugins\org.eclipse.pde.core\tempp2metadata
